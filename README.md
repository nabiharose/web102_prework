## Notes

A significant challenge I encountered involved getting the filter feature to work properly for the "Show Funded Only" and "Show Unfunded Only" options. At first, the list of games didnâ€™t refresh as it should. After going through the JavaScript logic line by line, I spotted a small error in the condition that was causing the problem and corrected it.


Styling the application also posed its own difficulties. Centering and aligning components proved trickier than anticipated. I tried different approaches, and after some trial and error, I achieved the desired layout by leveraging Flexbox.
